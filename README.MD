##Learning JS Playground

A place to study JS. Practicing using the book EloquentJS.

All files are at `public` folder because I use a local Express server to render JS properly embeding CDN and another stuff. ;) A small trick! :)

For layout I use Milligram, a Tiny and fantastic CSS Framework. Look at they site for more information on https://milligram.io/
